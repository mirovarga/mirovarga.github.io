<p><em>Mar 27, 2015</em></p>
<p>On Mar 8, 2015, inspired by reading about affiliate marketing (mostly on
<a href='http://reddit.com/r/entrepreneur'>Reddit</a>), I came up with a ~~great~~ idea that
it couldn&#39;t be so difficult to earn money this way and that I would give it a try.</p>
<h2 id="The-Idea">The Idea</h2>

<p>My idea was to build a website similar (but different enough) to
<a href='http://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com'>This Is Why I&#39;m Broke</a> or
<a href='http://mommyiwantthis.com'>Mommy I Want This</a> to help people decide what to buy
for their friends, family or themselves when they want something but don&#39;t know
yet what it should be.</p>
<h2 id="The-Implementation">The Implementation</h2>

<p>I chose the <a href='https://affiliate-program.amazon.com'>Amazon affiliate program</a> as
I read it was easy to start with (though the commission isn&#39;t that great).
Also, Amazon sells a lot of products and is widely known so it has some trust
among customers.</p>
<p>At first, I planned to handpick some of the best selling products from several
categories, but when reading the documentation I found that Amazon provides an
<a href='https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html'>API</a>
to access their products.</p>
<p>So I signed up for both the affiliate program and the products API and built
the website in the evenings and over the weekends. Finally, I made it live on
Tuesday.</p>
<h2 id="The-Reality-Check">The Reality Check</h2>

<p>To get feedback (and also some traffic while Google indexes the website)
I submitted a post on Reddit. The feedback I got was quite useful but one thing
bothered me. Several people warned me that my website would be rejected by Amazon
after they review it because it lacks any original content. As I couldn&#39;t find
anything about it in the license agreements I googled for a while and
<a href='http://trafficplanet.com/index.php?/topic/8422-got-rejected-by-amazon-associates-this-is-how-you-can-fix-it'>found</a>
that they could be
<a href='http://corporatetangent.com/public/2014/12/06/amazon-associates-application-rejected-lessons-learned/'>right</a>.</p>
<h2 id="The-Conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>

<p>So far I made two sales and decided that I would wait while Amazon reviews
the website. In case they reject it I will have to approach the idea differently.</p>
